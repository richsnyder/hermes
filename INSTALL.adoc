= Installation

== Quick Start

The basic process for setting up Hermes on a Unix-like or Mac OS X system with
default configuration options is:

----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake /path/to/hermes-x.y.z
make install
----

Detailed instructions are provided below.


== Prerequisites

Hermes relies on a handful of external software packages that are not included
in the Hermes distribution.  These are:

CMake::
  The CMake build system is used to manage compilation, testing, and
  installation.  It can be downloaded at https://cmake.org/download/.
  CMake versions 3.0 and above provide the necessary functionality.

C++ compiler::
  A pass:[C++] compiler that supports the pass:[C++14] standard is required to
  build the Hermes source generator and the pass:[C++] language binding.  The
  following compilers are known to work:
  * Apple Clang 7.3
  * GNU C++ 6.1
  * Intel C++ 16.0

Fortran compiler::
  The Hermes Fortran binding relies on features found in the Fortran 2003
  standard.  The following compilers are known to work:
  * GNU Fortran 6.1
  * Intel Fortran 16.0

boost::
  The Hermes code generator uses the Boost optional and variant header-only
  libraries.  Boost can be obtained at  http://www.boost.org/users/download/.
  Version 1.60 or higher is required.

libzmq::
  The Hermes C++ and Fortran language bindings interface with the native C
  library of Ã˜MQ.  This software can be found at
  http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software.  Version 4.1 or above is required.

asciidoctor::
  The asciidoctor text processor and publishing toolchain is used to generate
  documentation.  If you wish to build the documentation, then you will need
  to have it installed on your system.  You can find installation instructions
  at http://asciidoctor.org.


== Configure Phase

Before you can build the software artifacts from the source code, you need to
generate a set of build instructions that are suitable for your system.  Hermes
uses the CMake program to make sure that all prerequisites are satisfied and to
see that the build process is properly configured.

Hermes can be configured and built in a different location than the root
distribution directory.  This is called an *out-of-source* build and is
recommended because it keeps all intermediate files separate from the original
source.  To prepare for an out-of-source build, create a temporary directory
and run `cmake` from within this directory.

----
mkdir build
cd build
cmake /path/to/hermes-x.y.z
----

The `cmake` program runs without user interaction.   Interactive text- and
graphics-based user interfaces for CMake may be installed on your system.
These will be named `ccmake` and `cmake-gui`, respectively, and may be used in
place of the `cmake` command line interface.

=== Compilers

CMake will probe your system for common C++ and Fortran compilers and select
the first ones that it finds.  If it has trouble finding a suitable compiler or
if you wish to override its choice, you can force the selection by setting the
`CXX` and `FC` environment variables.  For example, to force use of the Intel
compilers:

----
CXX=iCC FC=ifort cmake /path/to/hermes-x.y.z
----

=== Installation Prefix

By default, artifacts will be installed under `/usr/local`.  The installation
location can be changed by setting the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` CMake option.

----
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install /path/to/hermes-x.y.z
----

=== Language Support

CMake will, by default, build a language binding if it can satisfy all of that
binding's dependencies.  The CMake options `WITH_CPP` and `WITH_FORTRAN` can be
set to change this behavior.  They can be assigned any of the following values:

`AUTO` (default)::
  Enable the language binding if its dependencies can be satisfied.
`ON`::
  Halt if a required dependency cannot be satisfied.  Otherwise enable the
  binding.
`OFF`::
  Disable the language binding without checking for its dependencies.

For example, the following command will skip the Fortran binding while
requiring C++ support.

----
cmake -DWITH_CPP=ON -DWITH_FORTRAN=OFF /path/to/hermes-x.y.z
----

=== Specifying Python Interpreter

If your system has multiple Python interpreters you can directly specify paths
to the desired interpreter and `pip` package manager to ensure they don't get mixed
by CMake.

----
cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/path/to/python -DPip_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/pip/or/pip2 /path/to/hermes-x.y.z
----

=== Documentation

By default, documentation will be built if the document generation toolchain
can be found.  The `WITH_DOCS` CMake variable can be used to change this
behavior.  Valid values are:

`AUTO` (default)::
  Create documentation if the document generation toolchain can be found.
`ON`::
  Halt if the documentation toolchain cannot be found.  Otherwise, build the
  documentation.
`OFF`::
  Do not build the documentation.

For example, the following command disables generation of the documentation:

----
cmake -DWITH_DOCS=OFF /path/to/hermes-x.y.z
----


== Testing

By default, unit tests will not be built.  The `BUILD_TESTS` CMake variable can
be used to configure the build to include available tests.  Valid values for
this variable are:

`ON`::
  Build all of the unit tests that correspond to enabled features.
`OFF` (default)::
  Do not build any of the unit tests.

The following command enables testing:

----
cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON /path/to/hermes-x.y.z
----


== Build Phase

After the build has been configured with CMake, you can generate the Hermes
artifacts by executing:

----
make
----


== Testing Phase

If testing was enabled in the configuration phase with `-DBUILD_TESTS=ON`, the
following command will trigger execution of all of the generated tests.

----
make test
----

A summary of the test results will be printed to the screen.  Afterwards, the
full output generated by the tests can then be found under the
`Testing/Temporary` folder in the build directory.


== Install Phase

The final phase of the build process is to move the artifacts into their
installed location.

----
make install
----
